# Day 65 Tasks

Run in Bash/Ubuntu WSL from 2026/day-65/. Cloud commands are intended steps, not evidence of execution. AWS credentials are absent. Resource creation needs cloud authorization, and deletion/state surgery needs cleanup or data-change authorization. Do not paste credentials into files or command output.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` | Expose the tools installed in the user-local bin directory. |
| `terraform version; aws --version; aws sts get-caller-identity` | Verify tools and identity before cloud execution; keep identity output private. |
| `cd terraform-modules` | Enter this day's independent Terraform project. |
| `terraform fmt -recursive; terraform init -backend=false -input=false; terraform validate` | Format and validate locally; -backend=false skips remote backend initialization and -input=false avoids prompts. |
| `terraform init` | Initialize the normal local backend before plan/apply. For shared state, configure a dedicated remote backend first. |
| `terraform plan; terraform apply` | Preview and deploy the final registry VPC, shared SG and two EC2 child calls after cloud authorization. |
| `terraform output; terraform state list` | Inspect both public IPs and module-prefixed state addresses. |
| `terraform init -upgrade; terraform plan` | Optional upgrade exercise: update providers within constraints and re-review the plan; registry module exact pins stay fixed. |
| `terraform destroy` | Delete the module-managed exercise resources after cleanup authorization. |

## Submission (pending)

After completing the cloud exercises and reviewing the day evidence, run from the repository root. Do not include unrelated AGENTS.md or local caches/state. The commands below describe the later cloud completion submission. Local preparation is committed separately for this day; push was not performed.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cd /home/afarinha/git/90DaysOfDevOps` | Move to repository root. |
| `git add 2026/day-65/` | Stage only Day 65 after checking ignored/secret files. |
| `git commit -m "Day 65 - Completed - Complete validated infrastructure exercise"` | Create the required English completion commit only when the exercise is actually complete. |
| `git push origin master` | Publish to the configured fork branch; requires working GitHub authentication. |
